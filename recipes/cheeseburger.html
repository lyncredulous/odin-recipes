    <p>Keep the kids happy with these wallet-friendly cheeseburgers - ready in just 35 minutes and you can freeze leftovers.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1kg minced beef</li>
        <li>300g breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>140g extra-mature or mature cheddar, grated</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 small bunch parsley, finely chopped</li>
        <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Step One</h3>
            <p>Crumble the mince in a large bowl, then tip in the breadcrumbs, cheese, Worcestershire sauce, parsley and eggs with 1 tsp ground pepper and 1-2 tsp salt. Mix with your hands to combine everything thoroughly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step Two</h3>
            <p>Shape the mix into 12 burgers. Chill until ready to cook for up to 24 hrs. <em>Or freeze for up to 3 months. Just stack between squares of baking parchment to stop the burgers sticking together, then wrap well. Defrost overnight in the fridge before cooking.</em></p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Step Three</h3>
            <p>To cook the burgers, heat grill to high. Grill burgers for 6-8 mins on each side until cooked through. Meanwhile, warm as many buns as you need in a foil-covered tray below the grilling burgers. Let everyone assemble their own, served with their favourite accompaniments.</p>
